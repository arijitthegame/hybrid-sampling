Code to run hybrid sampling schemes to compare against the softmax sampling. All experiments are run on langauge modeling tasks. The datasets used are Penn Tree Bank, Wikitext 2 and Wikitext 103. We will just use a biLSTM for all the experiments. The goal here is to prove the efficacy of these hybrid schemes and not the model itself.

The code needs cleanup. Will combine the LSTMs in the near future by removing the directions arguments.
